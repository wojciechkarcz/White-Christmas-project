## BACKGROUND

There is a common belief in Poland that we should expect snow during Christmas and in the past it was the norm.. During this analysis, I decided to check on hard historical data how exactly that day looked like in terms of weather over the past 70 years. The main goal will be to create a map of Poland showing areas with a snow occurence on December 25th.
