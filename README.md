# What is the chance for white Christmas in Poland?
  
## OBJECTIVE

The aim of this project is to answer a simple question based on meteorological data - what is the chance of snow during Christmas in Poland?

## JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS
  
  
## BACKGROUND

There is a common belief in Poland that we should expect snow during Christmas and it used to be normal for there to be snow during this period. During this analysis, I decided to check on hard historical data how exactly that day looked like in terms of weather over the past 70 years. The main goal will be to create a map of Poland showing areas with a snow occurence on December 25th.
